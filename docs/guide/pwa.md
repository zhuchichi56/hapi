# Progressive Web App (PWA)

HAPI's web interface is a fully-featured PWA that can be installed on your phone for a native app-like experience.

This page covers browser installation. For the SwiftUI/UIKit and Kotlin
Compose clients, see [Native apps (iOS / Android)](./native-apps.md).

## What is PWA?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that can be installed on your device and works like a native app:

- **Home screen icon** - Launch HAPI like any other app
- **Full screen mode** - No browser chrome, immersive experience
- **Offline support** - Basic functionality works without internet
- **Auto-updates** - Always get the latest version

## Installing HAPI PWA

### Android (Chrome/Edge)

1. Open HAPI in Chrome or Edge browser
2. Look for the **"Install HAPI"** banner at the bottom
3. Tap **"Install"**
4. HAPI appears on your home screen

::: tip
If you don't see the install banner, tap the three-dot menu and select **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install app"**.
:::

### iOS (Safari)

1. Open HAPI in Safari browser
2. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Tap **"Add"** in the top right corner

::: warning
iOS requires Safari for PWA installation. Chrome/Firefox on iOS don't support the "Add to Home Screen" feature.
:::

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge)

1. Open HAPI in your browser
2. Click the install icon in the address bar (⊕)
3. Or use the menu: **"Install HAPI..."**
4. HAPI opens as a standalone window

## PWA Features

### Offline Mode

When offline, HAPI can:

- Display cached session lists
- Show previously loaded messages

HAPI does not queue actions taken while offline — an offline banner appears at the top when you lose connection, and live features resume once you're back online.

### Auto-Update

HAPI checks for updates in the background and lets you choose when to reload:

- Updates are checked hourly and when you return to the tab
- When a new version is available, a persistent in-app banner appears at the top
- Tap **Reload** when you're ready to apply the update — the banner stays until you do
- Expand **"Why can't I dismiss this?"** on the banner for the rationale

HAPI uses a user-controlled reload instead of forcing an automatic refresh, so you choose when to reload. The banner cannot be dismissed without upgrading, so you won't forget you're on an old build.

### Share Target (Android)

On Android, HAPI appears in the system share sheet. When you share content to HAPI:

1. Chrome sends a `POST /share` multipart form (title, text, URL, and files) to the app
2. The service worker intercepts the request and stores the payload in IndexedDB
3. The app is then redirected (303) to the share picker, which reads the stored content

This lets you share images, PDFs, text, and other files directly into a session from any app.

### Native / deep-link ingest

Companions that cannot use Web Share Target (for example a native app on a headset share sheet) can open the same picker with a fragment deep link:

```
{hapiOrigin}/share#url=…&text=…&title=…
```

- Fragment params: `url`, `text`, `title` (all optional; omit empty). Optional companion file hand-off: `fileUrl`, `fileName`, `fileType` — the page fetches `fileUrl` (CORS) into the same IndexedDB `files[]` as Web Share Target (capped at the same 50 MiB upload limit). The fragment is **not** sent on the HTTP request, so shared content does not appear in hub access logs.
- When any are present and query `id` is absent, the web app synthesizes the same IndexedDB transfer used by the POST path, scrubs the fragment, then continues with the session picker / create-new flow (`?id=`).
- When query `id` is present (Web Share Target redirect), that path wins; fragment content is ignored for ingest.
- Deep links cannot embed binaries in the fragment; a companion may hand off one file with `fileUrl`. Use Web Share Target POST for direct or multi-file payloads.

See [Web Share Target](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/web-share-target) for the POST vs GET distinction.

## Caching Strategy

HAPI uses intelligent caching:

| Content | Strategy | Duration |
|---------|----------|----------|
| App shell | Cache first | Until update |
| Sessions API | Network first | 5 minutes |
| Machines API | Network first | 10 minutes |
| Session detail API | Network first | 5 minutes |
| CDN (cdn.socket.io) | Cache first | 30 days |
| CDN (telegram.org) | Cache first | 7 days |
| Static assets | Cache first | Forever |

## Notifications

HAPI supports push notifications to alert you when agents need attention.

### Enable Notifications

1. Open HAPI - a permission popup appears automatically
2. Tap **Allow** to enable notifications
3. If you missed the popup, go to system settings to grant permission

### Notification Types

| Type | When Sent |
|------|-----------|
| Permission Request | Agent needs your approval |
| Ready | Agent finished and awaits input |
| Task completed / Task failed | A background task finishes (success or failure) |

### Native app notifications

The [native Android and iOS apps](./native-apps.md#notifications) use FCM and
APNs. Official builds use encrypted push relay delivery by default; private
builds need matching provider configuration. If a native provider accepts a
notification for any device in your namespace, the hub skips the Web Push
duplicate for that dispatch. Missing registrations or failed sends retain the
Web Push fallback. Provider acceptance is not a handset receipt. See
[Native app notifications](./notifications.md#native-app-notifications).

::: tip
If push notifications don't work in your region (e.g., FCM unavailable), use [Telegram integration](./notifications.md#telegram-setup) instead.

### Windows taskbar badge

When HAPI is installed as a PWA from Microsoft Edge or Chrome on Windows, users can show the number of sessions with activity newer than the local last-seen watermark on its taskbar icon. The setting is disabled by default because some Edge/Windows configurations render the same host badge as overlapping layers, with one layer offset and clipped by the taskbar. Use Settings > Display > Session list > Taskbar unread badge to opt in or out for this PWA. The badge is updated while the PWA has a current session snapshot; it is not shown for a normal browser tab, and the read state remains local to that browser/PWA profile.

## Managing Your PWA

### Check Install Status

HAPI shows different UI based on install status:

- **Not installed** - Shows install prompt
- **Installing** - Shows progress indicator
- **Installed** - No prompt shown

### Uninstalling

**Android:**
1. Long-press the HAPI icon
2. Drag to "Uninstall" or tap the X

**iOS:**
1. Long-press the HAPI icon
2. Tap "Remove App" → "Delete App"

**Desktop:**
1. Open HAPI
2. Click the three-dot menu
3. Select "Uninstall HAPI"

### Clearing Cache

If you experience issues:

1. Open HAPI in browser (not installed version)
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Application → Storage
4. Click "Clear site data"

## Best Practices

### Battery Optimization

On Android, disable battery optimization for HAPI to ensure notifications arrive promptly.

Settings → Apps → HAPI → Battery → Unrestricted

### Data Usage

HAPI uses minimal data:

- Initial load: ~500KB
- Cached after first load
- Only syncs changed data

### Multiple Devices

You can install HAPI on multiple devices:

- All devices use the same server
- Sessions sync across devices
- Same access token works everywhere

## Troubleshooting

### Install Button Not Showing

- Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for PWA)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if already installed

### App Not Updating

1. Close the app completely
2. Reopen and wait for update prompt
3. If stuck, clear cache and reinstall

### Offline Mode Not Working

- Ensure you've loaded the app at least once online
- Check if ServiceWorker is registered (DevTools → Application)
- Clear cache and reload

### iOS-Specific Issues

- Must use Safari for installation
- Limited offline capabilities

## Telegram Mini App Alternative

If PWA doesn't suit your needs, consider the Telegram Mini App:

- Works inside Telegram
- No separate installation
- Same features as PWA
- Integrated notifications

See [Notifications](./notifications.md#telegram-setup) for Telegram setup.
