# hapi-web

React Mini App / PWA for monitoring and controlling hapi sessions.

## What it does

- Session list with status, pending approvals, todos, and summaries.
- Chat view with streaming updates and message sending.
- Permission approval and denial workflows.
- Codex `request_user_input` choices honor `isOther`: **None of the above**
  focuses optional notes, supports empty notes, and preserves the canonical
  wire value across languages. Recorded other answers and notes remain visible
  in live and historical cards; Pi/MCP forms without the flag are unchanged.
- Permission mode and model selection.
- Machine list and remote session spawn.
- File browser and git status/diff views.
- PWA install prompt and offline banner.
- Optional unread-session count on the Windows taskbar when installed as an Edge/Chrome PWA (toggleable in Display settings; off by default).

## Runtime behavior

- When opened inside Telegram, auth uses Telegram WebApp init data.
- When opened in a normal browser, you can log in with `CLI_API_TOKEN:<namespace>` (or `CLI_API_TOKEN` for the default namespace).
- The login screen includes a top-right hub picker; if unset, the app uses the same origin it was loaded from.
- Live updates come from the hub via SSE.
- Session `@` suggestions require conversation content, including untitled conversations. Names and directory labels affect display/search, not eligibility; empty stubs stay excluded.

## Routes

## Features

### Session list (`src/components/SessionList.tsx`)

- Active/inactive status indicator.
- Session title from name, summary, or path.
- Todo progress display.
- Pending permission request count.
- Agent name and model display.

For a personal Hub that should show one named project across working directories,
set all three build-time variables before building the Web assets:

```sh
VITE_HAPI_SINGLE_PROJECT_MACHINE_ID=machine-id \
VITE_HAPI_SINGLE_PROJECT_DIRECTORY=/Users/example \
VITE_HAPI_SINGLE_PROJECT_LABEL='My Project' bun run build:web
```

Only sessions from that machine share the named group. Their stored working
directories remain unchanged; the configured directory is used by the group
header's copy-path and new-session actions. Other machines retain directory
grouping. Replace `machine-id` with the current Runner's machine ID and use an
absolute directory path. Without all three variables, the standard grouping
remains in use.

To omit retired machines from sidebar navigation without deleting their session
history, set `VITE_HAPI_HIDDEN_MACHINE_IDS` to comma-separated Runner machine IDs
when building the Web assets. Their sessions remain accessible by direct link;
remove the IDs and rebuild to restore the navigation entries. Sidebar search,
machine filters, and unread totals all use the same visible set.

### Chat interface (`src/components/SessionChat.tsx`)

- Message thread with infinite scroll.
- Composer for sending messages.
- Permission mode and model selection for supported agents.
  Cursor Auto uses CLI Auto for new/resumed sessions configured with Auto. When ACP does not advertise a literal Auto option, the session picker warns that switching back from a concrete model requires a restart; HAPI does not automatically restart an active session.
- Session abort and handoff controls.
- Codex **Continue planning** hides the current proposal's action menu locally
  and focuses the composer without sending a message or replacing its draft.
  The plan document remains readable; recycled cards stay dismissed and new
  proposals get fresh action menus.
- Context size display.
- Per-session scratchlist (`src/components/AssistantChat/ScratchlistPanel.tsx`)
  - Workbench panel for held notes/drafts; **distinct from the queue**.
  - Add/delete/reorder entries; promote to composer (copy) or queue (send).
  - Entries and attachments saved on the hub and synced across devices.
  - Reordering affects only the current view and resets when entries refresh.
  - Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S to focus the add-input.

### File browser (`src/routes/sessions/files.tsx`)

- Git status view (staged/unstaged files).
- File search with ripgrep.
- Navigate to file viewer.

### File viewer (`src/routes/sessions/file.tsx`)

- File content display with syntax highlighting.
- Staged/unstaged diff view.

### Terminal (`src/routes/sessions/terminal.tsx`)

- Remote terminal via xterm.js
- Real-time via Socket.IO `/terminal`
- Resize handling

### Voice assistant

- ElevenLabs (@elevenlabs/react), Gemini Live, and Qwen Realtime backends
- Real-time voice control
- Standard and realtime composer dictation with provider capability selection

### New session (`src/components/NewSession/`)

Modular session creation:

- Machine selector
- Directory input with recent paths
- Agent type selector
- Model selector
- Per-agent permission, effort, and collaboration controls when supported

### First-User-Experience (FUE)

For a new, non-essential feature whose affordance would otherwise be hard to
discover, consider the existing FUE primitive rather than a permanent UI block.
Optional, not a requirement for every feature or a reason to expand a bug fix.

- `src/lib/use-fue.ts`: `useFue(featureId)` returns `{ status, engage, dismiss }`; acknowledgement is isolated per feature in `hapi.fue.v1.<featureId>` localStorage keys.
- `src/components/Fue.tsx`: `FueDot` marks the affordance; `FueCallout` explains it while `status === 'engaging'`.
- Dismissal requires an affirmative user action ("Got it"), never an auto-timeout.
- The FUE dot and feature-specific badges/counters are mutually exclusive; onboarding wins until acknowledged.
- Opt in per feature; skip the wrapper if an upstream component already supplies onboarding.
- Working example: `ScratchlistToggleButton` in `src/components/AssistantChat/ComposerButtons.tsx`. Use the source rather than maintaining a copied example here.

## Authentication

See `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` and `src/hooks/useAuthSource.ts`.

- Telegram Mini App: Uses initData from WebApp SDK.
- Browser: Uses CLI_API_TOKEN from login prompt.
- JWT tokens with auto-refresh.

## Data fetching

See `src/hooks/queries/` for query hooks and `src/hooks/mutations/` for mutations.

- Sessions, messages, machines via TanStack Query.
- Git status and file operations.
- Optimistic updates for message sending.

## Real-time updates

See `src/hooks/useSSE.ts`.

- SSE connection to `/api/events`.
- Session/message/machine update events.
- Automatic cache invalidation on events.

## Stack

React 19 + Vite + TanStack Router/Query + Tailwind + @assistant-ui/react + xterm.js + @elevenlabs/react + socket.io-client + workbox + shiki.

## Source structure

- `src/router.tsx` - Route definitions.
- `src/components/` - UI components.
- `src/hooks/` - Data fetching and state hooks.
- `src/api/client.ts` - API client.
- `src/types/api.ts` - Type definitions.

## Development

From the repo root:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev:web
```


If testing in Telegram, set:

- `HAPI_PUBLIC_URL` to the public HTTPS URL of the dev server.
- `CORS_ORIGINS` to include the dev server origin.

## Tests

Unit tests run under vitest + jsdom:

```bash
bun run test:web
```

End-to-end browser tests for the scratchlist component (real Chromium, real
`inert` focus blocking, real localStorage round-trips) live at the repo root
under `e2e/`:

```bash
bun run test:e2e          # headless
bun run test:e2e:ui       # Playwright UI mode (debug)
```

The spec drives a Vite-served fixture page (`web/e2e-fixtures/scratchlist-fixture.html`)
that mounts the production `ScratchlistPanel` in isolation, so no hub /
auth / socket setup is required.

## Build

```bash
bun run build:web
```

The built assets land in `web/dist` and are served by hapi-hub. The single executable can embed these assets.

## Standalone hosting

You can host `web/dist` on a static host (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages) and point it at any hapi hub:

1. Build the web app. If your static host uses a subpath, set the Vite base:

```bash
bun run build:web -- --base /<repo>/
```

2. Deploy `web/dist` to your static host.
3. Set hub CORS to allow the static origin (`HAPI_PUBLIC_URL` or `CORS_ORIGINS`).
4. Open the static site, click the top-right Hub button on the login screen, and enter the hapi hub origin.

Clear the hub override in the same dialog to return to same-origin behavior.
