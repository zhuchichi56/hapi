 *
 * - token fetch → connect → handshake gate (`connection-changed

 * - resume cursor = last non-null frame id, kept **per key** (a cursor
 *   replayed under a different filter set would verify against the wrong
 *   filter), advanced only **after** the downstream emit returns — i.e. after
 *   every collector has accepted the event into its collect loop. A busy
 *   collector therefore holds back acknowledgement of every later event
 *   (at-least-once; per the contract, handlers must be idempotent);
 * - 90 s staleness watchdog ticking every 10 s (any frame counts, heartbeats
 *   included; checks skipped while backgrounded);
 * - exponential backoff 1 s → 30 s (300 s after 8 attempts) + jitter, first
 *   retry immediate, attempt counter reset on every successful handshake;
 * - one silent token refresh per cycle on 401, costing no backoff attempt;
 * - [setLifecycleForeground]: backgrounding defers retries but keeps a live
 *   connection open (OS-imposed teardown grace is the caller's concern);
 *   foregrounding releases deferred retries immediately and force-reconnects
 *   a connection whose last activity is older than 45 s.
 *
 * All waiting uses `kotlinx.coroutines` [delay] on the provided [scope], so
 * `runTest` virtual time drives the whole state machine ([nowMs] must then be
 * the test scheduler's clock).
 *
 * Usage: collect [events] **before** [subscribe] — emissions with no
 * collector are dropped (zero-replay [SharedFlow]).
