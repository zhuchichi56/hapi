/**
 * FCM entry point (B-M4a). Messages are **data-only** by contract
 * (`docs/api/native-companion-contract.md`) — a `notification` block would
 * stop `onMessageReceived` from running in the background — so every render
 * decision is client-side: [PushPayload] parses/routes, [PushNotifications]
 * builds, and the one suppression rule ([shouldSuppressPush]) skips the OS
 * notification only when the app is foreground *with that session's chat
 * open* (the in-app SSE stream is already showing the event).
 *
 * Without a Firebase config this service is inert — no token, no delivery —
 * and [app.hapi.companion.push.PushBinding] keeps the rest of the push
 * surface no-op'd to match.
