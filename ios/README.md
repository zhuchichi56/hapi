# HAPI iOS (native companion)

Native SwiftUI client for HAPI. Fully independent of `web/` at the code level;
it shares only the protocol contract (`docs/api/`) and the golden fixtures
(`shared/fixtures/`, produced by the consistency track).

## Requirements

- Xcode 16 or newer (iOS 17 SDK).
- Deployment target: iOS 17.0.
- Runtime dependencies (SPM, declared in `Packages/HapiKit/Package.swift`,
  used only by the `HapiUI` target): `swiftlang/swift-markdown` (GFM parsing
  for the custom renderer) and `raspu/Highlightr` (code highlighting, kept
  behind a protocol so it is swappable). `HapiProtocol`/`HapiClient` stay
  dependency-free.

## Build

Open `ios/Hapi.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the shared `Hapi` scheme, or from
the command line:

```sh
# App (simulator, no signing)
xcodebuild build -project ios/Hapi.xcodeproj -scheme Hapi \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO

# Package tests (also runs on macOS, the package is pure Foundation)
swift test --package-path ios/Packages/HapiKit
```

CI runs both on `macos-15` via `.github/workflows/ios.yml` (triggered by
changes under `ios/**` and `shared/fixtures/**`).

### Localization catalog

`Hapi/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` is hand-maintained. Compiler string
extraction stays disabled so opening or building the project does not rewrite
the catalog with decorative or intentionally verbatim strings.

### Linux verification (no Mac needed)

`ios/scripts/linux-test.sh` compiles and tests the non-UI targets
(HapiProtocol + HapiClient and their test suites, including the
`shared/fixtures` golden suites) in a Swift Linux container:

```sh
ios/scripts/linux-test.sh                # full swift test in docker
ios/scripts/linux-test.sh --filter Chat  # extra args pass through to swift test
```

Requires docker; defaults to the `swift:6.1-noble` image
(`HAPI_SWIFT_IMAGE` overrides). The script rsyncs the package and the
fixtures into a repo-depth staging dir (`HAPI_LINUX_STAGE` overrides;
kept between runs so builds are incremental) and mounts it at `/work`,
so the tests' `#filePath`-relative fixture resolution works unchanged.
Always edit the real worktree files — every run re-stages them.

HapiUI (SwiftUI + swift-markdown + Highlightr) cannot build on Linux;
`Package.swift` drops the UI product/targets and their dependencies
under `#if os(Linux)`, and the script leaves those sources out of the
staging copy. The few Darwin-only APIs in HapiClient are conditionally
compiled (`#if canImport(Security)` for the Keychain store — Linux tests
use `InMemoryCredentialStore` through the `CredentialStoring` seam;
`#if canImport(CryptoKit)` for snapshot-file digests with an FNV-1a
fallback; `#if canImport(FoundationNetworking)` for URLSession types and
a delegate-based SSE transport where `URLSession.bytes` is unavailable).

                         Since M2f the app target links HapiUI and renders
                         chat prose/code/diffs through it; RootView injects
                         the palette and the \.hapiOpenURL link handler.
```

The app target stays thin; features live in `HapiKit` so they are testable
with `swift test` and free of UI concerns.

### Fixtures

`HapiProtocolTests` reads the golden fixtures from the repo-root
`shared/fixtures/` directory, resolved from the test file's own `#filePath`
(package root `ios/Packages/HapiKit` -> `../../../shared/fixtures`), so the
suite needs a full repo checkout. Since M1a, `FixtureDecodingTests` decodes
every `chat/*.json` input as `[DecryptedMessage]` (+ `AgentState`), and
`CatalogTests` verifies the ported mode tables against
`catalogs/modes.json`. Since M2b/M2c, `ChatFixtureTests` is the pipeline
gate: for every chat fixture it runs the ported normalize → reduce → group
pipeline over the stored `input`, applies the normative projection, and
compares canonical JSON byte-for-byte against the stored `expected` —
failures are per-fixture and print the first differing line with context.
Since M2d, `HapiClientTests/PaginationFixtureTests` replays every
`pagination/*.json` op script against the real `MessageWindowController`
driven by a scripted `MessagesProviding`: it asserts the exact `GET /messages`
query objects (`expectedRequests`, including the explicit-null
`untilAt`/`untilSeq` of the first catch-up request), the older-load outcomes,
the queued-state reconcile candidates, and the final window projection
(`expectedState`) — all canonical-JSON compares with the same per-op labels
and first-differing-line diffs. Since M2f, `HapiClientTests/ChatPipelineTests`
drives the app-facing `ChatPipeline` runner with fixture-derived window rows:
non-empty unique stable ids, memo-stable recomputes, the queued-row filter,
and group-id stability across an older-page arrival (`previousGroups`).
Since M3ab, `HapiClientTests/Chat/ChatInteractorTests` transcribes the
Android interaction suite against the real client stack (only HTTP is
scripted): canonical approve/deny/send/config wire bodies asserted
byte-for-byte, optimistic send happy/fail/retry, 409 → resume → retry (same
and superseding id), queued cancel invoked-race, steer reconcile, edit
prefill, permission override lifecycle, and config optimistic + rollback.
Since A-M3f, `Attachments/AttachmentPolicyTests` ports the Android policy
matrix, `Attachments/ComposerAttachmentsTests` drives the upload tray over
the real client (exact base64 upload bodies, consume/retry/remove,
mid-upload removal orphan delete, detached discard),
`Voice/DictationControllerTests` transcribes the Android dictation suite
(fake recorder + transport), `EndpointRequestTests` covers the voice
endpoints (multipart shape included), and `ChatInteractorTests` gains the
attachment-send matrix (metadata on the wire byte-for-byte, refuse while
uploading, attachments-only sends, retry with identical attachments,
remove/discard deletes).
Since A-M4a, `HapiProtocolTests/Git/*` transcribes the Android git-parser
suites (expectations produced by running the exact inputs through
`web/src/lib/gitParsers.ts`), and `HapiClientTests/Files/*` transcribes the
files/viewer model suites against a fake gateway (numstat merge + degraded
banners, lazy tree cache, search debounce, staged-toggle reload, the
auto-fallback rules, base64/image/binary classification) plus asserts the
six git/files endpoint URLs against the recording performer.
Since A-M4b, `Stores/ScratchlistStoreTests` transcribes the Android
scratchlist store suite (optimistic CRUD reconcile/rollback, at-cap 409 +
local short-circuit, SSE-invalidation refetch for observed sessions, upload
in-flight progress + typed 413, attachment delete 409/ok mapping, limits
cache/offline defaults — canonical wire bodies asserted) plus the
`SessionListStore` invalidation-seam test; `ScratchlistAttachmentGuardTests`
ports the nine budget-verdict cases; and
`Chat/ChatInteractorScratchlistTests` covers the park/insert/badge seams
against a fake store.

## Pairing (M1d)

How to pair the app with a hub (`docs/api/client-contract/auth.md` is the
contract; the app accepts multiple hubs and keeps one active):

- **Local hub, manual entry** — the everyday dev loop:
  1. Start the stack from the repo root: `bun run dev` (or just the hub). The
     hub prints its URL and the access token (`CLI_API_TOKEN`, auto-generated
     into the hub's `settings.json` on first run).
  2. In the app: *Enter Manually* → hub URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.20:3006`
     — the phone must reach the hub's LAN address, not `localhost`; a typed
     address without a scheme gets `http://` prefixed) → paste the token →
     *Continue* → *Pair*.
  3. The app checks `GET /health` (reachability + `protocolVersion`), then
     exchanges the token via `POST /api/auth` and stores it in the Keychain.
- **QR scan** — start the hub with `--relay`: the terminal prints two QR
  codes. The scanner accepts **both** — the companion deeplink
  (`hapicompanion://bind?hub=…&code=…`, canonical) and the web direct-access
  URL (`https://<web>/?hub=…&token=…`). The web app's Settings → Companion
  Pairing screen renders the deeplink QR too.
- **Deep link** — opening a `hapicompanion://bind` link routes through the
  same confirm sheet; a link for an already-paired hub just switches to it.
- **Simulator**: camera scanning is unavailable (`DataScannerViewController`
  unsupported) — the scanner screen says so; use manual entry. Plain-HTTP LAN
  hubs work because `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` stays enabled (ATS default
  otherwise).
- **Sign out** (home → hub menu) deletes the stored token for that hub and
  falls back to the next paired hub, or to pairing. A hub that terminally
  rejects its stored token (rotated/revoked → `POST /api/auth` 401) is signed
  out automatically with a banner.

Manual test pass for the app layer (the pairing sequence itself is covered by
`PairingLogicTests` via injected HTTP fakes; `AppModel`/views are UI-bound):
pair via manual entry against a local hub → kill + relaunch (restores paired
state, SSE reconnects) → background/foreground (connection dot pauses and
resumes) → pair a second hub and switch between them → sign out of both →
scan both `--relay` QR forms → open a `hapicompanion://bind` link from Notes
(unpaired: confirm; paired: "already paired" notice) → rotate
`CLI_API_TOKEN` on the hub and watch the auto sign-out banner.

## Push notifications (P3)

End-to-end encrypted APNs push, mirroring the Android FCM stack
(`docs/api/native-companion-contract.md` + the iOS extension below).

**How it works**

- **Registration.** After the first successful pairing the app asks for
  notification permission (standard alert/sound/badge prompt — the Android
  timing: never on a pristine unpaired install), registers with APNs, and
  sends `POST /api/devices/register`
  `{token: <hex APNs token>, platform: "ios", deviceId: <stable UUID>,
  pushKey: <base64 32-byte key>}` to **every** paired hub — each hub pushes
  independently for its own namespace. Registration re-runs on every app
  start and token rotation (cheap upsert; heals reinstalls and hub-side
  pruning), and Settings → Notifications has a manual *Re-register push*.
  Sign-out sends a best-effort `DELETE /api/devices/register {token}` from a
  credentials snapshot taken before the Keychain wipe. There is no
  background retry queue (the Android WorkManager part has no iOS
  equivalent) — the next trigger heals transient failures.
- **E2E envelope.** The hub never sends plaintext through APNs. The wire
  notification is `{aps: {mutable-content: 1, alert: <generic>},
  hapi: {v: 1, e: <envelope>}}` where `e` is
  `base64(nonce[12] || AES-256-GCM ciphertext || tag[16])` over the FCM
  data-contract JSON, keyed by this install's `pushKey` with AAD
  `hapi-push-v1`. Whether the hub delivers via direct APNs or a relay is
  entirely hub-side — the app only ever registers and decrypts.
- **Notification Service Extension.** The `HapiNotificationService` appex
  decrypts on device: reads the push key from the shared Keychain access
  group (`$(AppIdentifierPrefix)run.hapi.companion.push`,
  after-first-unlock so lock-screen pushes decrypt), swaps in the real
  title/body, stamps the action category, and stores the decrypted fields in
  `userInfo` for the tap/action handlers. Undecryptable payloads deliver
  the generic alert unchanged. The appex links nothing beyond the SDK — it
  carries a ~60-line copy of the HapiKit `PushEnvelope` decrypt, kept honest
  by the shared test vector.
- **Actions.** `permission-request` → Allow / Deny; `ready` and
  `task-notification` → inline Reply. Handlers run in the notification
  delegate's async completion and resolve the owning hub Android-style
  (active hub first, then the roster; 404 "Session not found" / 403 = try
  the next hub) — approve/deny post `{}`, reply posts `{text, localId}`.
  Failures surface as a local notice instead of vanishing. A tap deep-links
  to the session chat; a push for the chat currently on screen is suppressed
  (the in-app SSE stream is already showing it).

**Layer map**: `HapiClient/Push/` (envelope + payload + key, Linux-tested),
`Endpoints/DeviceEndpoints.swift` (register/unregister),
`Hapi/Models/PushCoordinator.swift` (registrar + delegate + action runner),
`HapiNotificationService/` (the appex). The AES-GCM decrypt and the contract
test vector are verified by `HapiClientTests/Push/*` — structural checks run
in the Linux container, the CryptoKit vector/tamper tests on Darwin CI.

**First build with push (Xcode-side, once):** the project now has two
targets. Signing is `Automatic`, but a personal/team identity is required
for push entitlements:

1. Select your team under *Signing & Capabilities* for **both** the `Hapi`
   app target and the `HapiNotificationService` extension target.
2. The app target ships `Hapi/Hapi.entitlements` (`aps-environment:
   development` — Xcode/App Store flips it to `production` at distribution)
   plus the shared keychain group; the extension ships the keychain group
   only. If Xcode prompts to register the capability, accept — free personal
   teams cannot sign push entitlements, a paid/organization team is needed.
3. Simulators cannot receive APNs: expect `didFailToRegister…` there (the
   Settings row shows the error). Everything else — decrypt, categories,
   actions — can be exercised with `xcrun simctl push` using a payload whose
   `hapi.e` was produced with the device's registered key.

## Milestones (track A of the native-clients plan)

- **M0** — this scaffold: project, HapiKit package, CI, one passing test.
- **M1** — foundations: HapiProtocol wire models + catalogs; APIClient + auth
  (Keychain, single-flight 401 refresh); SSEClient + reconnect state machine +
  versioned patch application (incl. gzip streaming check); pairing flow
  (VisionKit scan + `hapicompanion://bind` deep link + multi-hub).
- **M2** — read-only chat: session list; chat pipeline port
  (normalize/reducer/toolGroups, fixtures green is the gate); message window
  store; Markdown/code/diff renderers; read-only ChatView with paging.
- **M3** — interaction: composer (optimistic send, queue/steer, drafts,
  reopen migration, slash commands); permission UX; new session; attachments.
- **M4** — secondary features: files/git; Scratchlist; dictation;
  usage/storage (Swift Charts); settings.
- **M5** — polish: zh-CN localization, Dynamic Type/VoiceOver, long-session
  memory profiling, App Store material.

## Notes

- The `hapicompanion://` URL scheme is registered via `Hapi/Info.plist`,
  alongside the camera (QR pairing + attachment capture) and microphone
  (dictation) usage strings; everything else is generated through
  `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` + `INFOPLIST_KEY_*` build settings. The modern
  out-of-process `PhotosPicker` needs **no** photo-library permission, so
  there is no `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`.
- `run.hapi.app` is the bundle id; signing is `Automatic` and CI builds
  with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`.
- CI uses the runner's default Xcode; each job prints `xcodebuild -version`
  first so failures are attributable to a toolchain bump.
