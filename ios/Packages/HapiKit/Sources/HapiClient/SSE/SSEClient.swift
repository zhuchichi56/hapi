/// - Watchdog: 10 s ticks; connect attempts that have not opened within
///   10 s are abandoned; 90 s without any bytes tears the connection down.

/// - Backoff per `ReconnectPolicy`; the attempt counter resets on every
///   successful open, so the first retry after a healthy connection is
///   immediate.
/// - `suspend()`/`resume(staleThresholdCheck:)` for app lifecycle: retries
///   are deferred while suspended; on resume a surviving connection that
///   has been silent ≥ 45 s is torn down and rebuilt immediately.
